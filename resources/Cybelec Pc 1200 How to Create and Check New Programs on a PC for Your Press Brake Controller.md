Cybelec Pc 1200 has two versions: 2D and 3D. The 2D version is suitable for simple machines that do not require complex bending calculations or simulations. The 3D version is more advanced and can handle multi-axis machines, 3D graphics, collision detection, and offline programming.
  
Both versions of Cybelec Pc 1200 have a user-friendly interface that guides you through the steps of creating and editing programs. You can enter the parameters of your machine, such as dimensions, tools, materials, and angles. You can also import CAD files or draw your own shapes using the built-in drawing tools. You can then preview the result on the screen and make adjustments as needed.
  
Cybelec Pc 1200 also has a DNC (direct numerical control) function that allows you to transfer programs from your computer to your machine via a serial or USB cable. You can also use a network connection or a floppy disk to transfer programs. Once the program is loaded on the machine, you can start the machining process and monitor the progress on the screen.
  
Cybelec Pc 1200 is compatible with most brands and models of machines that use Cybelec controllers. It can also be customized to suit your specific needs and preferences. You can change the language, units, colors, fonts, and other settings of the software. You can also create macros, subroutines, variables, and formulas to simplify your programming.
