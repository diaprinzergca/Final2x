## Why Do You Need to Reset Your Epson Workforce K101 Printer?
 
Like most inkjet printers, the Epson Workforce K101 printer has a waste ink pad that collects the excess ink that is used during the printing process. This waste ink pad helps to prevent clogging and maintain the print quality of your printer. However, over time, the waste ink pad can get saturated and reach its maximum capacity. When this happens, the printer will display an error message on the screen or on your computer, telling you that the ink pads are full and need to be replaced. This error message will prevent you from using your printer until you replace the ink pads or reset the printer.
