# Review: Anthony Hamilton - Back to Love (Deluxe Version)
 
Anthony Hamilton is one of the most soulful and consistent singers in the contemporary R&B scene. His fifth studio album, *Back to Love*, released in 2011 by RCA Records, showcases his smooth vocals and heartfelt lyrics over a variety of musical styles. The deluxe version of the album includes four bonus tracks that add more depth and diversity to the project.
 
The album features writing and production from some of the industry's finest, such as Babyface, Dre & Vidal, Kelvin Wooten, Mike City, Jairus Mozee, Avila Brothers, as well as Hamilton himself. The result is a cohesive and satisfying collection of songs that range from upbeat and funky ("Woo", "Sucka for You") to mellow and romantic ("Pray for Me", "Best of Me") to introspective and spiritual ("Back to Love", "Life Has a Way").

Hamilton's voice is the star of the show, as he delivers each song with passion and conviction. He can convey a range of emotions with ease, from joy and excitement to pain and regret. He also displays his versatility as a singer, as he switches between different registers and tones. He can croon softly on a ballad like "Never Let Go" (featuring Keri Hilson), belt out powerfully on a gospel-inspired track like "I'll Wait (To Fall in Love)", or rap confidently on a hip-hop influenced song like "Mad" (featuring Busta Rhymes).
