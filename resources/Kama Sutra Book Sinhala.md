The first Sinhala translation of the Kama Sutra was done by Sirisena Wimalawansa Thero in 1883. He titled his work as "KÄma KalÄpa", which means "The Garland of Love". He used a poetic style and added his own commentary and illustrations to explain the original text. He also included some local customs and practices that were relevant to the Sinhalese culture.
 
Since then, there have been many other Sinhala translations and adaptations of the Kama Sutra, such as "KÄma RatnÄkara" by D. B. Jayatilaka in 1929, "KÄma Saá¹graha" by P. B. Senanayake in 1936, "KÄma Saá¹skÄra" by W. A. de Silva in 1952, "KÄma Saá¹yoga" by M. D. Ramanayake in 1964, and "KÄma SÅ«tra" by Ananda Rajakaruna in 1978.
 
These Sinhala versions of the Kama Sutra have not only preserved the ancient wisdom of VÄtsyÄyana, but also enriched it with their own insights and experiences. They have made the Kama Sutra accessible and appealing to a wider audience of Sinhalese readers who are interested in learning more about the art and science of love.
  
The Kama Sutra Book Sinhala is not only a translation of the original Sanskrit text, but also a commentary and adaptation that reflects the Sinhalese culture and context. The Sinhalese translators and authors have added their own examples, stories, anecdotes, tips, and illustrations to make the Kama Sutra more relevant and appealing to their readers. They have also modified some of the original concepts and practices to suit their own preferences and norms.
 
For instance, the Sinhalese versions of the Kama Sutra have given more emphasis to the emotional and spiritual aspects of love, rather than the purely physical and sensual ones. They have also highlighted the importance of mutual respect, consent, loyalty, and fidelity in sexual relationships. They have discouraged adultery, violence, coercion, and exploitation in sexual matters. They have also advocated for the equality and dignity of women in sexual matters.
 
The Sinhalese versions of the Kama Sutra have also incorporated some of the local customs and traditions that are related to love and sexuality. For example, they have mentioned some of the auspicious days, times, places, and rituals for sexual intercourse. They have also described some of the local herbs, foods, drinks, oils, perfumes, and ornaments that can enhance sexual pleasure and health. They have also explained some of the local signs, gestures, expressions, and words that can convey sexual interest and consent.
 
The Kama Sutra Book Sinhala is not only a source of information and instruction on love and sexuality, but also a source of entertainment and inspiration for Sinhalese readers. It is a book that celebrates the beauty and joy of human sexuality in all its diversity and complexity. It is a book that encourages Sinhalese readers to explore their own sexuality and express it in a respectful and satisfying way.
