## Plot
 
The Brave Animation Hindi Dubbed Mp4 Movie 30 follows the same plot as the original English version, with some minor changes and additions. The movie starts with Raju's father leaving for a war against the evil king Ravana. Raju wants to go with him, but his father tells him to stay home and take care of his mother and sister. Raju feels sad and angry, and wishes he could be brave like his father.
 
One day, he finds a map that leads to his father's sword, which is hidden in a cave. He decides to follow the map and find the sword. He sneaks out of his house and sets off on his adventure. On his way, he meets a princess named Maya, who is running away from her arranged marriage with Ravana's son. She joins Raju on his quest, hoping to find a way to escape her fate.
 
They also meet a dog named Moti, who was once a human prince cursed by Ravana for refusing to marry his daughter. Moti helps Raju and Maya with his wit and loyalty. Finally, they encounter a dragon named Shakti, who was also cursed by Ravana for guarding the sword. Shakti agrees to let Raju take the sword if he can pass three tests of bravery.

However, the voice acting also has some drawbacks. Some voice actors sound too old or too young for their characters, and some sound too similar or too different from their original English counterparts. Some dialogues are poorly translated or adapted from English to Hindi, and some sound awkward or unnatural in Hindi. The movie could have improved its voice acting by choosing more suitable voice actors or by improving its script.
