You can lock any of the edges of the grid by right-clicking on them and choosing Lock Edge. This will prevent them from being affected by the deformation.
3. If you want to subdivide or dice the object for smoother deformation, you can right-click on it and choose Subdivide or Dice from the context menu. This will create more faces on the object and make it more flexible.
4. When you are happy with the result, you can right-click on the object and choose Apply FFD from the context menu. This will remove the grid and finalize the deformation.
