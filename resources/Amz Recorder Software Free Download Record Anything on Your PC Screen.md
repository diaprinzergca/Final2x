## What is AMZRecorder?
 
AMZRecorder is an audio kit that uses the AVFoundation framework to record audio in MPEG4 (m4a) format, which is optimized for the smallest size possible. According to Zahr, the size of an audio file in KB of duration 10 seconds is 164 for kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC, compared to 430 for kAudioFormatAppleLossless, 475 for kAudioFormatAppleIMA4, 889 for kAudioFormatULaw, and 889 for kAudioFormatALaw[^1^]. AMZRecorder also allows you to set the maximum recording time in seconds, and provides delegate methods to help you implement your UI changes whenever you change from a state to another. For example, you can use the delegate methods to display the recording time, the progress of the player, or the countdown of the remaining time.
 
## How to Install AMZRecorder?
 
To install AMZRecorder, you need to have Xcode installed on your Mac and a device running iOS 8.0 or later. You can download Xcode from the App Store for free. Then, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download or clone the AMZRecorder repository from GitHub[^1^].
2. Open the AMZRecorder.xcodeproj file in Xcode.
3. Connect your device to your Mac via USB cable.
4. Select your device as the target in Xcode.
5. Build and run the project on your device.

You should see a simple interface with four buttons: Record, Pause, Play, and Stop. You can use these buttons to test the functionality of AMZRecorder.

## How to Use AMZRecorder?
 
To use AMZRecorder in your own project, you need to drag and drop the files "AMZRecorder.h" and "AMZRecorder.m" to your project. Then, you need to import the header file in your view controller:
 `#import "AMZRecorder.h"` 
Next, you need to create an instance of AMZRecorder and set its delegate:
 `AMZRecorder *audioKit = [[AMZRecorder alloc] initAudioRecorder];
audioKit.delegate = self;` 
You also need to conform your view controller to the `` protocol and implement its required methods:
 `- (void) AMZAudioDidStartRecording;
- (void) AMZAudioDidPauseRecording;
- (void) AMZAudioDidStartPlaying;
- (void) AMZAudioDidPausePlaying;
- (void) AMZAudioDidStopPlaying;` 
These methods are mainly used to help you update your UI according to the state of the recorder. For example, you can use them to change the color or title of a button, or to show or hide a label. You can also implement some optional methods that help you keep track of the recorded file:
 `- (void) AMZAudioRecordingTime: (double)recordTime totalRecordedTime: (double)totalRecordTime;
- (void) AMZAudioDidSaveRecord: (BOOL)succeed error: (NSError*)error;` 
The first method gives you access to the current recording time, the total recorded time, and the progress of the player. The second method tells you if the record was successfully saved or not. You can use these methods to display some information or handle some errors.
