ApexSQL Log is a powerful tool that allows you to audit and recover data from SQL Server transaction logs. It can help you to track and undo changes made by users, applications, or system processes, as well as to restore deleted or damaged data. In this article, we will show you how to use ApexSQL Log to perform some common tasks, such as:
 
- Activating ApexSQL Log manually
- Auditing DDL and DML operations
- Rolling back or redoing transactions
- Exporting audit data to different formats
- Filtering and selecting logs to audit

## Auditing DDL and DML operations
 
ApexSQL Log can audit both DDL (data definition language) and DML (data manipulation language) operations that affect the structure and data of your SQL Server database. For example, you can audit operations such as:

- Create, alter, or drop tables, indexes, functions, procedures, triggers, views, etc.
- Grant, deny, or revoke permissions.
- Add, drop, or rename users.
- Insert, update, or delete data.

To audit these operations, you need to select the transaction logs that contain them. You can select online logs, detached logs, or log backups. ApexSQL Log will analyze the logs and display the details of each operation in a grid view. You can see information such as:

- The type of operation (insert, update, delete, etc.).
- The user who performed the operation.
- The computer and application that initiated the operation.
- The table and columns affected by the operation.
- The before and after values of each column.

## Rolling back or redoing transactions
 
One of the most useful features of ApexSQL Log is that it can help you to roll back or redo transactions that have been executed on your SQL Server database. This can be very helpful in cases where you need to undo unwanted or accidental changes or restore lost or corrupted data. To roll back or redo transactions, you need to follow these steps:

1. Select the transactions that you want to roll back or redo from the grid view.
2. Click Create Undo Script or Create Redo Script from the menu.
3. ApexSQL Log will generate a SQL script that contains the opposite operations of the selected transactions.
4. You can review and modify the script if needed.
5. You can execute the script on your database or save it for later use.

## Exporting audit data to different formats
 
If you want to save or share your audit data with others, you can export it to different formats using ApexSQL Log. You can export your audit data to CSV, SQL, or XML files. To export your audit
