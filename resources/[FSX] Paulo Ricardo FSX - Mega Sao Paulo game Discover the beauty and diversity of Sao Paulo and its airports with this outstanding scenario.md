The scenery is compatible with FSX and P3D, and requires the Global ORBX FTX software for the 3D NightLight effects. The performance is excellent, even with such a dense urban environment. The level of detail is impressive, with landmarks such as the Paulista Avenue, the Octavio Frias de Oliveira Bridge, the Ibirapuera Park, the Anhembi Sambadrome, and many others. The airports are also well modeled, with accurate runways, taxiways, buildings, and lighting.

If you are a fan of Brazilian aviation or just want to explore a new destination, this scenery is a must-have for your flight simulator.
  
One of the highlights of the [FSX] Paulo Ricardo FSX - Mega Sao Paulo game is the Santos Dumont Airport (SBST), located on an artificial island in the Atlantic Ocean, near the city of Santos. This airport is famous for its challenging approach and landing, as it has a short runway (1,500 m) surrounded by water and mountains. The scenery captures the airport's unique features, such as the bridge that connects it to the mainland, the hangars, the control tower, and the terminal building.
 
The scenery also includes the cities of Santos, GuarujÃ¡, SÃ£o Vicente, Praia Grande, Peruibe, Sorocaba, Itu, and others, with photoreal textures and custom buildings. You can fly over the coast and enjoy the beautiful beaches, or explore the inland areas and see the farms and hills.
