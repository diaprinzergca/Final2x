# Fate/Extra CCC English 29: How to Download and Play the Fan Translation
 
Fate/Extra CCC is a role-playing game developed by Type-Moon and Imageepoch for the PlayStation Portable. It is a sequel to Fate/Extra, which was released in 2010. Fate/Extra CCC follows the story of a new protagonist, who is either a male or female student at Tsukumihara Academy, a fictional school that exists inside a virtual world. The protagonist is involved in a war between Masters and Servants, who are historical or mythical figures summoned by the Holy Grail.
 
Unfortunately, Fate/Extra CCC was never officially released outside of Japan, leaving many fans of the Fate series unable to enjoy this game. However, thanks to the efforts of a dedicated fan translation team, Fate/Extra CCC English 29 is now available for download and play. This is the latest version of the fan translation project, which has been in the works since 2014. The team has translated about 80% of the game's script, including all of the main story and most of the side content.
