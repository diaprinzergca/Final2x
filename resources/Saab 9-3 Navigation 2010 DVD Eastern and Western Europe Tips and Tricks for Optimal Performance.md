Updating your navigation system is easy and takes only a few minutes. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Turn on your Saab 9-3 and insert the DVD into the slot in the dashboard.
2. The system will automatically recognize the DVD and ask you to confirm the update. Press OK.
3. The system will start copying the data from the DVD to the internal memory. This may take up to 20 minutes. Do not turn off the engine or eject the DVD during this process.
4. When the update is complete, the system will ask you to remove the DVD. Press OK and eject the DVD.
5. The system will reboot and load the new maps. You can now enjoy your updated navigation system.

Note: Depending on your region, you may need to use either DVD 1 (Western Europe) or DVD 2 (Central and Eastern Europe) for the update. You can check which DVD you need by looking at the map coverage on the back of the DVD case.
