Mega Man Legacy Collection is a compilation of the first six Mega Man games that were originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The collection features enhanced graphics, sound, and gameplay options, as well as a museum mode and a challenge mode. But if you want to spice up your Mega Man adventure even more, you might want to try using a trainer.
 
A trainer is a software that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate various cheats and hacks. For example, you can use a trainer to get infinite health, infinite retries, god mode, or set the game speed. This can make the game easier, harder, or just more fun depending on your preference.

There are several trainers available for Mega Man Legacy Collection on the internet, but one of the most popular ones is the FLiNG Trainer[^1^]. This trainer works with version 1.0 of the game and supports Mega Man X1, X2, X3, and X4. It has four options:
 
- Num 1 â God Mode/Ignore Hits: This option makes you invincible and immune to any damage.
- Num 2 â Infinite Health: This option gives you unlimited health and prevents you from dying.
- Num 3 â Infinite Retries: This option gives you unlimited retries and allows you to continue playing even if you lose all your lives.
- Num 4 â Set Game Speed: This option lets you adjust the game speed from 0.1 to 10 times the normal speed.

To use this trainer, you need to download it from the FLiNG Trainer website[^1^] and unzip it. Then, run the trainer and launch the game. During the game, press the corresponding keys to activate or deactivate the cheats. You can also customize the hotkeys in the trainer settings.
