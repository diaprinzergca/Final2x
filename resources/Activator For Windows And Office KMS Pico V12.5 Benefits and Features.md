## Risks of using KMS Pico
 
Although KMS Pico has many benefits, it also has some risks that you should be aware of before using it. Some of these risks are:

- KMS Pico is illegal to use. It violates the terms and conditions of Microsoft and infringes their intellectual property rights. Using KMS Pico can result in legal actions or penalties from Microsoft or other authorities[^2^] [^4^].

- KMS Pico may not be compatible with some antivirus programs or firewalls. Some antivirus programs or firewalls may block or remove KMS Pico as a potential threat or unwanted program. This may prevent you from using KMS Pico or the activated products[^2^] [^4^].
- KMS Pico may not be available from reliable sources. As mentioned earlier, there are many fake websites that claim to offer KMS Pico but actually contain malware or adware. Downloading KMS Pico from such websites can compromise your PC's security and privacy[^2^] [^3^].

Therefore, you should use KMS Pico at your own risk and discretion. We do not recommend using KMS Pico or any other hack tool for activating Windows and Office products. You should always buy a genuine license key from Microsoft if you can afford it. This way, you can support the developers and get regular updates and security patches.
